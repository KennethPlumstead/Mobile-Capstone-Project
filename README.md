# Livestock Listing Board  
**Mobile Capstone Project**

Livestock Listing Board is a read-only mobile marketplace prototype built with **Jetpack Compose**.  
The application demonstrates the UI/UX design and architectural foundations of a niche livestock classifieds platform.

This project was developed as a **mobile application capstone**, with a focus on clean UI, state management, navigation, and data handling rather than backend services or user authentication.

## Scope & Design Decisions

This project is intentionally **read-only**.

Features such as:
- User authentication
- Posting listings
- Messaging sellers
- Backend integration

are **out of scope by design** to keep the project focused on demonstrating:
- UI composition
- Navigation
- State management
- Clean architecture
- Practical scoping for a real-world prototype

All interactive actions (such as “Contact Seller”) are clearly labeled as **prototype-only**.

## Purpose

The goal of this capstone project is to demonstrate:
- Proficiency with modern Android development tools
- Clear architectural thinking
- User-focused interface design
- The ability to scope and complete a functional mobile prototype

---

## Future Improvements

- User accounts and authentication
- Posting and managing listings
- Seller-to-buyer messaging
- Remote backend integration
- Real-time data updates
